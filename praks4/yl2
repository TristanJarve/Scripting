#The goal of this script is to calculate the amount of cookies cooks need to cook a cookie cake given certain parameters.

#The variable names in this are horrible but I'm too lazy to fix it right now.

#Data about the tray
echo -n "Please enter the lenght and width of the cooking tray (in cm): "
read tlenght twidth

#Data about the cookies
echo -n "Please enter the lenght and width of the cookies (in cm): "
read clenght cwidth
echo -n "How many cookies are there in one pack?"
read amount

#How many layers?
echo -n "How many layers do you want for the cake?"
read layersAmount


#Calculations
trayArea=`expr $tlenght \* $twidth` 
cookieArea=`expr $clenght \* $cwidth` 
layerArea=`expr $trayArea / $cookieArea`
cookiesNeeded=`expr $layerArea \* $layersamount` 
packetAmount=`expr $cookiesNeeded / $amount` 
extraCookies=`expr $cookiesNeeded % $amount` 

#Answer
echo "You need $packetAmount packs of cookies and $extraCookies cookies on top of that!"
